#using the mathematical equation for Binomial coefficient allows us to calculate the amount of ways through a given grid
#this formula is expressed by n!/(k!(n-k)!)
def bincoe(n,k):
    return factorial(n)/(factorial(k)*factorial(n-k))

#The amount of ways through a 20x20 grid is then:
print(bincoe(20+20,20))
